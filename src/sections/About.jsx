                I work as a Machine Learning Engineer, building and evaluating data-driven systems that
                are designed to operate reliably beyond prototypes. My experience spans applied machine
                learning, data engineering, and AI system development, with a strong focus on translating
                ambiguous problem statements into production-ready solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’ve worked across domains such as financial decision systems, robotics and computer
                vision, and AI evaluation, where model performance, robustness, and real-world
                constraints are critical. I’m particularly interested in applied ML, MLOps, and
                agentic AI workflows where system design, monitoring, and decision quality
                matter as much as model accuracy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond technical work, I value clear communication, thoughtful system design, and
                continuous improvement. Outside of work, I enjoy singing and playing the guitar,
                experimenting with new recipes (especially baking and Indian cuisine), running,
                hiking, and exploring new places and food.
